Exercise 1: Write a program which repeatedly reads numbers until the user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a
number, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next number.

num =0
total = 0.0
while True:
   line = input('Please enter a number of your choice: ')
   try:
      if line == 'done':
         break
      fline = float(line)
      print(fline)
      num = num + 1
      total = total + fline
   except:
      print('Please enter a valid number')
      continue
print('done')  
print(total, num, 'Average: ', total/num)


Exercise 2:
 Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.
 
 num = 0
count = 0
large = None
small = None
while True:
   line = input('Please enter a number of your choice: ')
   try:
      if line == 'done':
         break
      fline = float(line)
      #print(fline)
      num = num +1
      count = count + fline
      if large is None or fline > large:
         large = fline
      if small is None or fline < small:
         small = fline
   except:
      print('Please enter a valid number')
      continue
print(num, count, large, small)
